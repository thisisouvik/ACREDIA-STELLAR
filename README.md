Acredia uses a unified Soroban smart contract deployed on **Stellar Network**:

<img src="frontend/public/deployment-proof.png" alt="Deployment Proof Output" width="800"/>

### ✅ AcrediaCredential Contract — Live on Testnet

> **Contract ID**: `CCGDFDLPELTOWG5H5OA4MBR5OZWDP4XJI3S3TQZVZ7XTVP77EKOFORYF`  
> **Network**: Stellar Testnet  
> **Owner / Deployer**: `GAJRNUO6HSMQG4FNHNWQVRXJZJZ7QRA7HXPYYB6H5PTA3EAAJXJNZD7U`  
> **Deployed**: 2026-04-01 (Updated Setup)
> **Explorer**: [View on Stellar Expert ↗](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/CCGDFDLPELTOWG5H5OA4MBR5OZWDP4XJI3S3TQZVZ7XTVP77EKOFORYF)

This single contract replaces two separate EVM contracts (CredentialNFT + CredentialRegistry) with one unified Soroban contract written in Rust. Additionally, it features upgraded Next.js boundary protection to bypass `@stellar/stellar-sdk` object coercions on the browser.

**Purpose**: Issue, store, and verify academic credentials on Stellar Network

**Key Features**:

- Authorization system — only admin-approved institutions can issue credentials
- Immutable on-chain credential storage with IPFS metadata links
- Credential lookup by token ID or SHA-256 hash
- Revocation mechanism with issuer-only control
- Timestamp-based issuance records via `env.ledger().timestamp()`

**Contract Functions**:

| Function | Access | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `initialize(owner)` | One-time | Initialize contract with owner address |
| `authorize_issuer(issuer)` | Owner only | Grant institution credential issuance rights |
| `revoke_issuer(issuer)` | Owner only | Remove institution authorization |
| `is_authorized_issuer(issuer)` | Public | Check if address is an authorized issuer |
| `issue_credential(student, issuer, hash, uri)` | Authorized issuers | Mint a new credential, returns `token_id` |
| `revoke_credential(token_id, issuer)` | Issuer only | Revoke an issued credential |
| `get_credential(token_id)` | Public | Fetch full credential struct by ID |
| `verify_credential(hash)` | Public | Look up credential by SHA-256 hash |
| `is_revoked(token_id)` | Public | Check revocation status |
| `total_credentials()` | Public | Get total credentials ever issued |

**Storage Architecture**:
- `DataKey::Authorized(Address)` → `instance` storage (low-cost, ephemeral)
- `DataKey::Credential(u64)` → `persistent` storage (permanent, survives ledger closings)
- `DataKey::HashIndex(String)` → `persistent` storage (hash → token_id index)

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

Acredia employs a rigorous testing methodology to ensure absolute security and reliability before deployment on the Stellar Network:

<img src="frontend/public/test-proof.png" alt="Test Proof Output" width="800"/>

### 1. Smart Contract Constraints (Rust)
- **DataKey Validation**: Utilizing `#[contracttype]` enumerations rigorously enforces that unique contract state keys are tightly managed off-ledger, avoiding standard library allocation exceptions (`no_std`) required by Soroban.
- **Address Validation**: Hardened validation ensuring `symbol_short!` usage keeps within maximum string lengths, confirming valid G-Type Stellar identities.

### 2. Frontend Validation & Logic (Vitest)
Comprehensive unit testing utilizing `vitest` covering all utility logic natively on the UI structure:
- **Ledger Identity Matching**: `isValidAddress` accurately verifies if a 55-character string matches the absolute Stellar Ledger Public pattern (`^G[A-Z2-7]{54}$`).
- **State Transition Machine**: Business-logic evaluations (`getNextStatus`) verifying strict one-way credential progression: _Draft ➔ Pending_Issuance ➔ Issued ➔ Revoked_. Hard-coded safety blocks malicious regression.
- **Malicious Payload Defense**: Dynamic testing blocking inputs containing short strings, missing public keys, or invalid empty object injections before the transaction reaches the `Freighter` wallet prompt.

### 3. Edge-case SDK Resiliency (Implemented)
- **Freighter API v6 Compatibility**: Safe-parse bypass resolving `e.switch is not a function` by seamlessly handling both string and object responses (`signedTxXdr`) natively returned during wallet transaction signing.
- **RPC Parsing Fallback**: Strict bypasses for parsing `xdr.ScVal` primitives (like booleans) ensuring boolean RPC responses (e.g., `is_authorized_issuer`) do not crash if executed directly through client-side Javascript prototype boundaries.
- **Zero-Balance Accounts**: The simulation explicitly constructs dummy `Account` sequences (e.g., Sequence "0") to ensure read-only blockchain queries execute gracefully even if the user connects an unfunded `0 XLM` wallet.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem: Freighter Wallet not connecting**

- Solution: Ensure you're on Stellar Testnet and site permissions are granted
- Refresh the page and try connecting again

**Problem: "Wrong Network" error**

- Solution: Switch to Stellar Testnet in your wallet settings

**Problem: Transaction failing**

- Solution: Check you have enough test XLM tokens in your wallet
- Verify wallet is authorized to issue credentials (for institutions)
- Ensure your sequence number is correct

**Problem: Contract deployment fails**

- Solution: Verify your identity is funded on testnet (`stellar keys fund deployer --network testnet`)
- Ensure sufficient XLM balance for deployment
- Check Soroban SDK version compatibility in Cargo.toml

**Problem: IPFS upload timeout / failed**

- Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT` is set in your `.env.local`
- Verify the JWT is valid at [app.pinata.cloud](https://app.pinata.cloud)
- Check your internet connection and try again
- Free tier is limited to 1 GB — check your Pinata dashboard usage

**Problem: Verification page shows "not found"**

- Solution: Ensure RLS policies are enabled in Supabase (run SQL scripts)
- Check contract addresses in `.env.local` are correct
- Verify token ID exists on blockchain

**Problem: Subjects not displaying**

- Solution: Clear browser cache and reload page
- Ensure IPFS metadata contains subjects array
- Check IPFS gateway is accessible
